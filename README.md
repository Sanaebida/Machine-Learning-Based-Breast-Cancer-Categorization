# Machine-Learning-Based-Breast-Cancer-Categorization
This project employs logistic regression in machine learning to categorize tumors (benign or malignant) using biopsy results, enhancing early detection and assessment of breast cancer.
Here are The steps for this logistic regression breast cancer classification project:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a dataset containing features from breast cancer biopsies, including characteristics like texture, radius, and perimeter.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, normalizing features, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.

3. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose logistic regression as the classification algorithm due to its effectiveness in binary classification problems.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Train the logistic regression model using the training dataset, optimizing parameters for the best fit.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset, considering metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

7. **Results Analysis:**
   - Analyze the results to understand how well the model classifies tumors and identify any areas for improvement.

8. **Deployment (Optional):**
   - share the trained model for real-world predictions, and why not integrating it into a broader healthcare system.
